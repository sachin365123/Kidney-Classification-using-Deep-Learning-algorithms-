This paper summarizes, the prediction of diabetic nephropathy of any patient using the deep learning image processing method namely VGG16 with 98 % accuracy. To accelerate the image training system design ROC and AUC curves have been defined also, to provide better results, optimal values have been compared with machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, etc. Patient images can be scanned digitally and the very first opinion can be obtained without expert knowledge acquisition.
Dataset has been collected from Shri Ram Murti Smarak Hospital, Bareilly MRI, and Mission Hospital, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India.
Keywords—deep learning, machine learning, medical care, diabetic nephropathy, VGG16

Abstract—India is the leading country in statistics in terms of mortality due to challenging hospital facilities and financial resources reach out to general people. Post COVID19, it has been researched that there is a big gap between traditional and recent medical facilities to patients inside hospitals all across the country. Furthermore, due to a lack of proper follow-ups and treatment of certain diseases like diabetes, millions of people are in extremis each day.
According to the International Diabetes Federation, over 460 million people are suffering from diabetes disease. Moreover, it has become one out of 10 causes of global
deaths all across the world. Post COVID19, traditional and new ways of medical care are also influencing the growth rate of this disease. [1] The risk of early death from diabetes is also increasing day by day, according to the recent report of the World Health Organization. Up to the present research, it has been observed that most COVID19 patients were suffering from diabetes. Deaths brought about by Diabetes can be predicted earlier by the hospital management as well. More than 422 million people
worldwide have diabetes, significantly in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.6 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. In India, the pie chart is
shown below. [13] With the hazardous result of this disease, most active parts of the body such as the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves can be damaged. [2]
India had observed 1,150300 deaths in 2019 with an age range of 20-70 years, which is among the top five countries among Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius.
Moreover, it is assuming that around 50 million are still not diagnosed with diabetes yet. In the upcoming year, the graph will increase unexpectedly [3].

Statistics showing India’s Diabetic deaths in India

II. MOTIVATION

A recent piece of research provides that as per primary diagnosis, 44.2 percent of the cause of kidney failure is diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy or diabetic kidney disease
determines the symptoms, causes and treatment of kidneys. Diabetic nephropathy can analysis corresponds to urinary excretion, secretion of proteins, chronic hyperglycemia,
malignant presence in the kidney etc.Most body functionalities are performed by kidney 

A. Types of Diabetic nephropathy Kidney nephropathy is the study of mellitus functionality inside stomach of human body. There are excess of glucose and insulin in body hence resulting diabetic causes mainly of two types, type 1 and type 2. For patients suffering from type 1, four percent will develop diabetic nephropathy within ten years, and twenty-five percent will develop diabetic nephropathy within twenty- five years. Moreover, For patients suffering from type 2, ten percent will develop diabetic nephropathy within five years, and thirty percent will develop diabetic nephropathy within twenty years.
